# ISTNeuralNetwork

This is a simple neural network model
developed and trained by Ethan Batick and Gianna Voce,
both comp sci students at Syracuse University to 
estimate the "business" of the on campus
"Barnes Center" student gym based on paramters such as
time the student wants to go, day of the week, etc.

***BEFORE RUNNING ANYTHING***
run "./dependecies.ps1" from the root directory.
This will install all the requried dependencies for 
these models

if you are trying to train a model yourself,
some algorithms require Nvidia Cuda (*** version 11.2 ***) to offload
math to the GPU, I use all version 11.2 in this project
